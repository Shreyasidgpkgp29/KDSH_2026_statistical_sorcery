95,1,"The Claim explains that Noirtier handed the conspiracy dossier to a British spy, which led to the Count of Monte Cristo acquiring it. This action does not contradict or make physically impossible the Observation that Villefort read the letter and arrested Dantès."
136,1,The claim explains how the Context happened as it describes the writing and sending of the work in question.
124,0,"Target: N/A | Proof: N/A | Why: The claim suggests that the shipowner saw Caderousse stealing a mooring rope but did not intervene. However, the context does not mention any such incident involving Caderousse. The claim is inconsistent with the provided context."
111,1,The claim explains how Dantès was able to make 'several anti-royalist moves' despite his physical weakness by using his connections and influence through old friends.
135,0,"Target: The claim states that he was arrested in 1800 and escaped the same year | Proof: In the context, it is mentioned that 'In 1807, a month before I was arrested', and later 'I was reading, for the thousandth time, the papers I was arranging, for the palace was sold to a stranger, and I was going to leave Rome and settle at Florence, intending to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed, my library, and the famous breviary when, tired with my constant labor at the same thing, and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten, my head dropped on my hands, and I fell asleep about three o'clock in the afternoon.' | Why: The context provides evidence that the person was arrested in 1807, not 1800 as stated in the claim."
110,0,Target: N/A | Proof: N/A | Why: The provided context does not mention any locked study or reading of revolutionary pamphlets or private letters. The claim is inconsistent with the context.
101,1,"The claim describes Andrea joining a radical republican cell at 18 years old, while the context mentions that when Andrea was only 11, he chose his companions from among the worst characters in Corsica. This suggests that Andrea's radical activities started earlier than the claim states."
91,1,"The Claim explains how Dantès, who is accused of assassinating Caderousse, also organized the assassination of royalist deputies. The presence of an arsenic phial in his study drawer supports the claim that he had the means to carry out such acts."
119,0,"Target: he scratched ‘On Ancient Mediterranean Routes’ into limestone with a nail | Proof: This: 'Dantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock; he listened until the sound of steps died away, and then, hastily displacing his bed, saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell, that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it.' | Why: The context describes Dantès laboring to remove plaster from a stone, not scratching anything into limestone with a nail."
93,0,"Target: He secretly raised the ‘Southern Army’ in Marseille | Proof: The sight of this officer recalled Villefort from the third heaven to earth; he composed his face, as we have before described, and said, ‘I have read the letter, sir, and you have acted rightly in arresting this man; now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the conspiracy.’ | Why: The context does not mention any discovery of an army raised by Villefort or evidence of such activity in Marseille."
97,1,"The claim explains that the character has knowledge and expertise in recognizing poison symptoms. The context describes a situation where the character substitutes a harmful drink with a healthy one, implying he did not recognize the poison."
121,1,The claim explains how the Mechanism (meeting Edmond Dantès' father) explains the Observation (recognizing the young sailor). The context does not indicate any contradiction or physical impossibility.
129,1,"The Context describes the priest learning to carve pen-nibs from cartilages of fishes and using a chisel, knife, and wooden lever as his tools. The Claim suggests he learned from an old Macao watchmaker, but there is no mention of him using any watchmaking tools or techniques in the carving process."
127,1,The claim explains how Dantès kept his wits during his imprisonment by calculating Mediterranean tides and using this knowledge to predict guards' rounds.
133,1,"The Claim explains how Faria's pious ideas returned and he discovered a new meaning in prayers, which had been forgotten for a long time. This shows that Enlightenment science can explain the Observation."

103,1,"The claim suggests a change in Noirtier's behavior during Napoleon's rise to dictatorship, but the context does not provide any evidence or observation that supports this change."
94,1,"The Mechanism (testing a new sedative on political prisoners) explains the Observation of the old man's violent trembling and convulsions, as well as his clenched jaws and attempts to vomit."
140,1,"The claim suggests that the friendships were formed during the prisoner's confinement, but the context does not provide any evidence or indication of such friendships being forged in secret cells or exile."
131,0,"Target: N/A | Proof: N/A | Why: The claim states that Dantès was born in 1760, but the context mentions events such as reading papers for the thousandth time, which happened a month before he was arrested in 1807."
132,1,"The claim states that Dantès was a star student at Rome University and was already publishing notes on history and natural philosophy by the age of eighteen.

115,1,"The Mechanism (reading the old Indian medical text Charaka Samhita) explains how the character gained his knowledge of toxicology, which is relevant to the context discussing his studies."
87,1,"The claim explains that his father was guillotined, but the context does not mention any physical impairments or signs of trauma associated with such an event, such as chronic hand tremors."
59,1,The claim explains how the character escaped captivity and survived in the mountains using specific skills.
60,1,The passage does not mention any avalanche or rescue operation involving Thalcave and Roux in 1852.
27,1,"The claim explains how Robert ended up at the docks (ran away and worked as a porter). The context describes him being on board the Duncan, climbing an abrupt declivity, throwing overboard merchandise, and other actions that are not consistent with being a dock porter."
42,0,"Target: N/A | Proof: N/A | Why: The claim states that 'He accepted a lucrative berth on the British merchant Britannia,' which contradicts the context stating 'Tom Ayrton, able seaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of Glasgow.' The claim's statement about being first mate on a different ship is not supported by the provided context."
56,0,"Target: N/A | Proof: N/A | Why: The claim suggests that the person (presumably Captain Grant) asked for credit to be given to 'the spirit of the plains' after predicting an earthquake and saving the party. However, there is no mention or observation in the context about any prediction of an earthquake or any supernatural intervention. Therefore, it seems that the claim contradicts the provided context."
80,1,"The claim describes events that happened after the context, explaining how Kara-Tété learned tactics, spear-craft, and jungle tracking from his father, became Junior Champion, and lost his father to pirate raiders. These events are not physically impossible given the context."
28,1,"The claim suggests that Tom Ayrton was framed by the captain of the brig Britannia for a crime he did not commit (taking the cargo-insurance money). However, the context provides no observation that would indicate this event occurred. The context only mentions Ayrton's identity being confirmed through a document found in a bottle after the shipwreck."
24,1,"The claim describes events that occurred after the context, so it explains how the observations happened."
72,1,"The claim explains that two of the twelve English-speaking youths were serving as spies and watching Glenarvan in Auckland. This is consistent with the context, which describes a group of faithful subjects ready to follow Lord Glenarvan on expeditions, and mentions no restrictions on their communication or movement."
16,0,"Target: N/A | Proof: N/A | Why: The context describes Robert as being born into a family of sailors in a country (likely Britain) and setting sail to explore the Pacific. The claim states that he was born in Calcutta, which contradicts the context's description of his origin."
30,0,"Target: N/A | Proof: N/A | Why: The claim states that Robert joined a pirate crew named Black Tide and became second mate within three years. However, the context provides no information about him leaving his position as captain of the Duncan or joining a pirate crew. Therefore, it is physically impossible for both events to have occurred according to the provided context."
22,1,"The Mechanism (secretly helping anti-colonial groups, adopting a creed, possessing correspondence) explains the Observations (discovery of odd books, learning Spanish, building a vessel and exploring Pacific islands)."
53,1,"The Claim explains how Thaouka survived falling off a cliff and recovering from injuries, making it consistent with the Context."
58,1,"The Context mentions that the learned geographer studied Spanish conscientiously to communicate with the natives, but the Claim states he was taught Spanish by the mission priest. However, the Context does not mention any encounter or interaction between the learned geographer and the mission priest."

47,1,"The claim explains that the captive's father was killed by colonists and the captive fled alone. This is supported by the context where it mentions the hardships faced by the 'unfortunate beings' at the hands of early colonists, and the captive's noble friend mentioning the capture of their father."
7,1,"The Mechanism (traveling light and keeping a bulging backpack) explains the Observation (he wore stout yellow buskins, leather gaiters, pantaloons of maroon velvet, and a jacket of the same material, whose innumerable pockets seemed stuffed with note-books, memoranda, scraps, portfolios, and a thousand articles as inconvenient as they were useless) by suggesting that he prioritized carrying scientific equipment over supplies."
51,1,"The Claim explains how horse-thieves attacked and the old shepherd died shielding Thalcave. The Context describes a different sequence of events, but it does not contradict the Claim as it is possible for multiple incidents to occur."
52,1,"The claim explains that the horse, Thalcave, was specifically trapped and tamed by the man. However, in the context, it is mentioned that Thalcave aided his master (the man) in clearing a passage for the horses that followed. This suggests that Thalcave was not just one specific horse but a general term for all the horses helping the man."
2,1,"The claim explains how Paganel learned Spanish, which is consistent with the context."
33,1,"The claim explains how the character joined Captain Grant's crew, aligning with the context of his patriotism and desire to serve Lord Glenarvan."
15,1,"The claim suggests that Kara-Tété, who is part of a native tribe, wears bone ornaments as a sign of civilization. However, there's no mention in the context about Kara-Tête wearing any bone ornaments. Therefore, it's not possible to determine if his tribe's degree of civilization can be gauged by studying his bone ornaments."
82,1,The Mechanism explains how the captive survived during his months of imprisonment and later communicated with others.
37,1,"The claim explains Tom Ayrton's knowledge of navigation and nautical skills, making it consistent with the context."
3,1,"The claim explains that after his mother's death, the son had a conflict with his father and left home. This is consistent with the context which mentions 'the birth of his son Robert' and later 'he found himself the possessor of a considerable fortune.' The claim also states that he took the Polynesian nautical charts she had bequeathed to him, which is also supported by the context as there are references to various documents belonging to him."
85,1,The claim explains how the Mechanism (volunteering to lead the pursuit) supports the Observation (he set sail to explore the great islands of the Pacific).
21,0,Target: N/A | Proof: N/A | Why: The Context does not mention any Royal Navy frigate or Lieutenant Grant. The claim is inconsistent with the provided observation.
49,1,"The claim describes him living alone for two years in the Andean border wilds, but the context mentions that he guides travelers across the passes of the Andes and consigns them to a 'laqueano' (Argentine guide), which implies he was not always alone."
64,1,"The claim explains how the Context occurred, as it describes an event (ferrying water and provisions to a burning barque and fishing a sailor from the sea) that is consistent with the Context's description of incidents."
61,1,"The claim explains that Robert's little sister Nawee was seized by slave-raisers, but the context describes that she was taken care of and educated by Robert's sister, not seized."
