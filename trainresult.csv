18,1,"The claim explains that the person was wary of the upper nobility due to witnessing bribery, which could have led to increased caution and suspicion towards them, as observed in the context."

68,1,"The Mechanism (reincarnation) explains how Kara-Tété was treated with respect by elders, as they believed he was a reincarnated warrior. The tattooing and the death-bed chant on his battle-axe also support this."

67,1,"The claim describes the character being born to specific parents and receiving certain tattoos. However, the context does not mention any of these details about the character Kara-Tété.

13,1,The claim explains that the character's deference to Lady Glenarvan is due to his tangled feelings towards his mother and his role as the expedition's 'living map' is an attempt to atone for failing to protect her. These actions do not contradict or make physically impossible any observations provided in the context.
1,1,"Jacques Paganel's extensive knowledge of geography as a learned geographer in the context is explained by his personal interest and study, which started at a young age as described in the claim."
11,1,"The claim explains that Tom Ayrton met with slave-traders secretly, which is consistent with the context stating his hesitation to pass through towns and villages."
65,1,"The Context describes the Duncan as a ship sailing in the Atlantic Ocean and its crew performing various tasks related to the ship. The Claim mentions 'canoe' and 'later berth on the Dartmouth', which are not present or mentioned in the Context, suggesting that the British officers were not handling canoes or preparing for a later berth on the Dartmouth during the events described in the Context."

69,0,"Target: He landed near the spot where Surville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized a son of the chief, Takouri | Proof: Though terribly bruised and still bleeding from his wounds, Louper hollowed a grave for the remains, and then, after many more days of privation and danger, came to the huts of some of the Maoris, by whose assistance he at length reached the settled parts of the colony. | Why: The claim states that Louper was captured by the Maoris, but in the context, it is mentioned that after being terribly bruised and bleeding from his wounds, Louper managed to reach the settled parts of the colony on his own. This contradicts the claim that he was captured."
50,1,"The Claim explains how Thalcave saved an old shepherd bitten by a viper, which is consistent with the Context describing Thalcave's actions to frighten away vipers."

20,1,"The claim explains how the character's courage and devotion were set forth by his noble friend, and his insistence on speaking despite his injury."

However, there is no mention of him being expelled by British colonists or burning his notes while recording thirty-two dialects along the Murray River in the provided Context."
62,1,"The claim explains that the person (Thalcave) is taciturn but also indicates an acute grief through his countenance, which contradicts being mute and acting more than speaking."
36,1,"The claim suggests that Paganel uses the Bible-quoting habit as a mask for his emotions, which could explain why his countenance indicated an intelligent and lively person but not one with a stern, unsmiling face (as suggested by the context). However, it does not contradict or make impossible any other observations in the context."

The claim provides a backstory that may have influenced Paganel's emotions but does not affect the physical actions described in the Context.
48,1,"The claim explains that the native wore a cloak made of guanaco skin and spoke Spanish, which are both observed in the context."
137,0,"Target: He was arrested for life | Proof: The exact excerpt from Context: ‘The order of imprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded.’ | Why: According to the context, the arrest order was issued but the release order hasn't been given yet. Therefore, he hasn't been arrested for life."
109,1,"The claim suggests that Villefort's change of political allegiance caused arguments with his father, but the context shows that Villefort's father was already a Jacobin (a radical supporter of the French Revolution and its ideals) and a Bonapartist (supporter of Napoleon), while Villefort himself was a Royalist. This means there was no change in political allegiance to cause arguments."
104,1,The claim explains that the father's assassination and the son's distrust of authority are due to their support for the Revolution. The context does not contradict this explanation.
134,1,"The claim explains how Andrea's past of being a wretch, robber, assassin, and his association with the worst characters at a young age can be attributed to his involvement in a secret society's campaign against corrupt rulers."
88,1,"The claim explains that 'Noirtier' (under an alias) was a member of the Girondins and played a role in drafting parts of the Revolutionary Code, which aligns with the context where Noirtier is described as a fiery Jacobin of the French Revolution and a man who helped overturn one of the greatest kingdoms."

92,1,"The claim explains that Noirtier publicly burned the betrothal contract and forced Villefort to flee, which is consistent with the context where it is mentioned that Noirtier never explained the affair to Villefort, leading him to believe his father fell victim to assassination, not a duel."
107,0,"Target: Napoleon’s triumph at Waterloo ended his hopes | Proof: It was not over the downfall of the man, but over the defeat of the Napoleonic idea, that they rejoiced, and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence. | Why: The context indicates that people were rejoicing over the defeat of Napoleon's ideology, not his personal downfall. This suggests that Napoleon continued to plot after Waterloo, contradicting the claim."
89,0,"Target: N/A | Proof: N/A | Why: The Claim describes a turning point in a historical event involving Louis XVI's trial in 1793. However, the Context provided is about Villefort and a different time period (1829). The Mechanism (turning point at Louis XVI’s trial) does not explain the Observation (Villefort's behavior in 1829)."
99,1,The claim explains that the character was born into a Parisian legal family with staunch republicanism from his father and gentler sensibility from his mother. The context does not contradict this information.
123,0,"Target: N/A | Proof: N/A | Why: The claim states that they studied Napoleon's secret letters in Rome, but the context indicates that the events described occurred before Napoleon was reinstated, which was after he left Rome."

113,0,"Target: Born in Parma | Proof: The exact excerpt from Context: 'He was a shepherd-boy attached to the farm of the Count of San-Felice, situated between Palestrina and the Lake of Gabri; he was born at Pampinara,' | Why: The claim states that Andrea was born in Parma, while the context clearly indicates that he was born at Pampinara."

120,0,"Target: N/A | Proof: N/A | Why: The claim describes an 'invented' ink that reveals under heat, which is not mentioned or observed in the context."
105,1,"The claim explains that Dantès became the head of an anti-Bonaparte society and organized underground actions. The context describes Dantès being arrested as a Bonapartist agent, which contradicts his role in the anti-Bonaparte society. However, it is possible that Dantès was framed or misunderstood, making the claim still plausible."
106,0,"Target: N/A | Proof: N/A | Why: The Context describes multiple encounters between characters, one of which is Caderousse and Fernand, but does not mention a society meeting involving both Fernand and Noirtier. The Claim suggests that Noirtier exploited Fernand's military information at this unmentioned society meeting. Therefore, the Claim is inconsistent with the provided Context."
118,1,The Mechanism explains how the Observation occurred by providing an alternative reason for the arrest and the information about the conspiracy.
126,0,"Target: His sister was burned as a witch | Proof: The part where it says 'If we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king, when, in their turn, they were in power, your brother would be today, in all probability, condemned to death.' | Why: The context does not mention any event or accusation suggesting that his sister was burned as a witch."
125,0,Target: N/A | Proof: N/A | Why: The prisoner in the context is not described as having killed anyone or shown any signs of being involved in military actions. The claim about him killing someone in India contradicts the provided context.
